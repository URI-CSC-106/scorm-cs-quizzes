### Reverse the items in an array

Write a function printReverse that accepts an array as its parameter and returns an array with the order of the elements reversed. Your program must use a loop and access of each array element to do this; you may not call a built-in Javascript function for reversing arrays.  Here are some test cases. 

```
var array1 = ['C', 'S', 'C', '1', '0', '6'];
var array2 = [2,4,6,8];

printReverse(array1);
printReverse(array2);
```
